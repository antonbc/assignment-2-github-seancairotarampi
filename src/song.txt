From the Start - Laufey

Hindi mo ba napapansin kung paano
Tahimik ako kapag walang tao?
Ako at ikaw at ang awkward na katahimikan
Huwag kang maglakas-loob na tumingin sa akin ng ganyan
Hindi ko kailangan ng mga paalala kung paano hindi pareho ang nararamdaman mo
Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp on 'bout some new soulmate
"She's so perfect, " blah, blah, blah
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me, confess your love, at least just let me say
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
What's a girl to do?
Lying on my bed, staring into the blue
Unrequited, terrifying
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest
I'm telling you today
That when I talk to you, oh, Cupid walks right through
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too?
Confess I loved you from the start
Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start
